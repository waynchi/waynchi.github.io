Hi, my name is Wayne. I am a first year Ph.D. Student in the [Computer Science Department](https://csd.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University advised by [Chris Donahue](https://chrisdonahue.com/). 

My research interests are broadly in the application of machine learning for creativity and game design / development. Topics I'm interested in include (but are not limited to):

- Creating more controllable and collaborative systems for generating multimedia.
- EFficient adaptation of foundational models to more niche use cases
- Attribution and unlearning

I did my undergrad and master's at the University of Southern California. Before starting my Ph.D., I spent around 7 years in industry working as Applied Scientist at AWS (2019-2023) and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (2016-2019). Taking the leap from industry to academia can be a hard decision; if you are also considering starting Ph.D. after years of industry, feel free to reach out.
