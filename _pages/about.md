Hi, my name is Wayne. I am a first year Ph.D. Student in the [Computer Science Department](https://csd.cmu.edu/) at CMU advised by [Chris Donahue](https://chrisdonahue.com/) and [Ameet Talwalkar](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~atalwalk/). 

My research interests are 1. in the application of machine learning for creativity and 2. human-centric machine learning (I like to think of this as a middle-ground between HCI and Machine Learning). Topics I'm interested in include (but are not limited to):

- Improved controllability for generative models
- Automated game design / development
- Language Models as Agents
- LLM Evaluation (especially in real-world settings)

I completed my undergraduate and master's at the University of Southern California. Before starting my Ph.D., I spent around 7 years in industry working as an Applied Scientist at AWS (2019-2023) and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (2016-2019). 
If you are interested in any of my research topics or considering a Ph.D. after industry feel free to reach out.
